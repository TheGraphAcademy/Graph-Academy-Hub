# The Graph Client

The Graph Client was created by core developer [TheGuild ](https://twitter.com/TheGuildDev)with the intention of making the dapp-building experience lightning-fast. The Graph Client allows users to query multiple subgraphs and to create a unified view from various data sources.

### 1. Easily fetch all the data needed&#x20;

The Graph Client comes with automatic support for pagination—there’s no need to make multiple queries when fetching larger datasets&#x20;

### 2. Streamline working with multiple subgraphs & querying them as one unified API

Fetch the data needed in the format it is needed it in. Combine NFT & DeFi subgraphs—& others!

### 3. Parse through data across different blockchains

The Graph Client combines data from both subgraphs & integrates them in a single place.

### 4. Multiple fetch strategies to gracefully handle Indexer fallback

Keep your dapp up & running reliably

### 5. Foundation for client-side mutations

Keeping the frontend clean & simplifies state management



### Other noteworthy features&#x20;

* Integration with Apollo Client & Urql&#x20;
* Runs in any environment&#x20;
* Automatic block tracking&#x20;
* Build time optimization
