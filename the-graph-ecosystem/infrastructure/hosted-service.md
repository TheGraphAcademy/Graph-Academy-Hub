# Hosted Service

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note, the Hosted Service is sunsetting in Q1 2023, but it will remain available until that time. All developers are strongly encouraged to [migrate their subgraphs](https://thegraph.com/blog/how-to-migrate-ethereum-subgraph) to the decentralized network. Read more about the sunsetting of the Hosted Service [here](https://thegraph.com/blog/sunsetting-hosted-service).

The **Hosted Service** is a completely free, but centralized interim solution provided by The Graph to make the transition process to the decentralized network more seamless. The Hosted Service supports indexing 24 networks. This service will eventually be sunset (target Q1/2023): [https://thegraph.com/legacy-explorer/](https://thegraph.com/legacy-explorer/)&#x20;

The **Subgraph Studio (Graph Explorer)** is part of the decentralized network: [https://thegraph.com/explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer) and [https://thegraph.com/studio/](https://thegraph.com/studio/).
