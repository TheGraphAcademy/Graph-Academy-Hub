# Mainnet

The Graph Network's mainnet introduces the first global and easily searchable index of blockchain data. It allows developers to easily search, find, publish and use the public data they need to build decentralized applications, without needing to rely on centralized servers and proprietary infrastructure. The Graph Network dramatically expands accessibility of decentralized applications through public and open APIs, called subgraphs that are used by hundreds of applications today. Launched in December 2020, The Graph's decentralized network is accessible via the Subgraph Studio.

The Subgraph Studio is your place to build and create subgraphs, add metadata, and publish them to the new decentralized Explorer (more on that [here](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/network/explorer/)).

What you can do in the Subgraph Studio:

* Create a subgraph through the Studio UI
* Deploy a subgraph using the CLI
* Publish a subgraph with the Studio UI
* Test it in the playground
* Integrate it in staging using the query URL
* Create and manage your API keys for specific subgraphs

Here in the Subgraph Studio, you have full control over your subgraphs. Not only can you test your subgraphs before you publish them, but you can also restrict your API keys to specific domains and only allow certain indexers to query from their API keys.

Querying subgraphs generates query fees, used to reward [indexers](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/network/indexing/) on the Graph network. If you’re a dapp developer or subgraph developer, the Studio will empower you to build better subgraphs to power your or your community’s queries. The Studio is comprised of 5 main parts:

* Your user account controls
* A list of subgraphs that you’ve created
* A section to manage, view details and visualize the status of a specific subgraph
* A section to manage your API keys that you will need to query a subgraph
* A section to manage your billing
