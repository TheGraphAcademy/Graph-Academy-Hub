# Multichain Migration

Full and updated list of networks supported by The Graph can be found here: [Discord.com](https://discord.com/channels/438038660412342282/438070183794573313/932639884819173397)

The Hosted Service currently supports 32 networks. The Hosted Service is a free, centralised service run by Edge & Node, one of the core developer teams at The Graph.

> The end of Q1 2023 reflects the sunsetting timeline only for The Graph Network-supported chains. As non-mainnet chains become supported on The Graph Network, their hosted service equivalents will sunset gradually to ensure developers have time to migrate subgraphs to the decentralized network.
