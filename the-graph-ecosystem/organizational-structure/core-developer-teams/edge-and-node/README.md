# Edge & Node

The idea behind The Graph Network was conceived and given shape by [Graph Protocol, Inc.](graph-protocol-inc..md) After having launched the mainnet of The Graph Network on December 17th, 2020, Graph Protocol, Inc. decided to change its name to [**Edge & Node**](https://edgeandnode.com/). The intention behind the change of the name was to highlight the ongoing decentralization in the network. As such, Edge & Node is no longer the central team developing and promoting the protocol. Instead, Edge & Node will provide services to the ecosystem and will be involved with the protocol.

### The Graph ecosystem also consists of:
