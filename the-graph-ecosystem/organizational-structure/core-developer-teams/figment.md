# Figment

Figment has received a core development grant of 80M GRT to be distributed over 5 years. Figment is joining The Graph ecosystem as a core protocol developer to grow the decentralized indexing layer for Web3.

> ”We're thrilled to have Figment join The Graph as a core dev and grow the developer horsepower,” said Eva Beylin, Director of The Graph Foundation. “The Figment team's experience with node infrastructure and multi-blockchain is unparalleled and their expertise will be invaluable to the community’s work in building out the protocol and The Graph ecosystem.” Figment will join [Edge & Node](https://edgeandnode.com/) and [StreamingFast](https://twitter.com/streamingfastio) as core developers on The Graph.

#### How Figment Fits Into What The Graph Is Building

The Graph ecosystem is driven by a future where individuals are active builders and owners of the services and protocols they use and love. The Graph Council believes this future will only be possible if strong teams across The Graph, and Web3 in general, can work together to develop critical infrastructure. Protocols allow many individuals and organizations to unite under a shared mission and develop decentralized infrastructure owned by communities, not corporations.

The Figment team is experienced with contributing to protocols, improving node infrastructure and indexing on The Graph. Joining The Graph community allows Figment to contribute to a decentralized and community-owned infrastructure for Web3, powering the future of the Internet. In this role, Figment will contribute to improving indexing performance, adding support for native network subgraphs, expanding multiblockchain support, and contributing to the evolution of the core protocol. Figment’s native DataHub service will also migrate to The Graph for its indexing infrastructure.

> "We are excited to establish a stronger presence on The Graph by becoming one of the three core development teams. The Graph is the most robust decentralized indexing protocol in the world, and we look forward to bringing this core infrastructure to more blockchain ecosystems."

Figment is a leading provider of staking, middleware, and application layer solutions for token holders and developers investing in and building on Web3 technologies. Their validator infrastructure, data indexers, and developer tooling spans across 35+ proof-of-stake networks, including The Graph. Their technology is already used by thousands of token holders and developers across the globe, with over $6B in assets staked to their infrastructure.

Figment began its journey in 2018 and its founding team has over 25+ years of experience building and scaling Internet infrastructure. This experience combined with a passion for open, borderless, and public systems makes Figment a perfect technical and mission driven team for The Graph ecosystem. Their technical expertise across a wide range of protocols will significantly streamline The Graph deployments on Solana, Polygon, Polkadot, NEAR, Celo, and more.

For years, decentralized applications ran on centralized nodes and servers, but now Web3-native infrastructure and data availability are paving the way for a new Internet marketplace of apps and services that are inherently decentralized and more financially inclusive. We are already beginning to see a blurring of the lines between Web2 and Web3 and both The Graph and Figment recognize Web3 is where the future lies.

The grant furthers Figment’s larger objective of developing infrastructure and protocols that support the ongoing evolution of decentralized public goods that are not owned by any one individual, corporation or entity. It also compliments Figment’s objective of building a better Internet by increasing usage of the next-generation of proof-of-stake blockchains.

Web3 is inevitable and as more projects join The Graph, the faster we'll get there. If you look closely, the future is already unveiling itself in Web3. An era of strong equality, privacy, and participation is upon us.
