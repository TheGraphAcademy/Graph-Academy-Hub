# Graph Advocates DAO

The Graph Advocates DAO is the community governing body that oversees membership and contributions of the [Graph Advocates Program](https://thegraph.com/blog/graph-advocates) and **community grants**. The DAO launched with 20 members who were part of the initial cohort of the Advocates Program and received a grant from The Graph Council for $250,000 worth of GRT to seed the treasury. In addition to community grants, the DAO treasury is expected to be used to compensate DAO members who contribute to the DAO itself and to fund reimbursements for Advocates activities.
