# Core Developer Teams

An overview of The Graph's core developer teams.

### Edge & Node

The idea behind The Graph Network was conceived and given shape by [Graph Protocol, Inc.](broken-reference) After having launched the mainnet of The Graph Network on December 17th, 2020, Graph Protocol, Inc. decided to change its name to [**Edge & Node**](https://edgeandnode.com/). The intention behind the change of the name was to highlight the ongoing decentralization in the network. As such, Edge & Node is no longer the central team developing and promoting the protocol. Instead, Edge & Node will provide services to the ecosystem and will be involved with the protocol.

### Streamingfast

StreamingFast is a protocol infrastructure company that excels at building highly scalable, cross-chain architecture for streaming blockchain data. **The $60M Core Dev Grant** is the first of its kind, pioneering a new frontier of collaborative innovation where communities and companies are aligned to build a radically more open Internet.

The StreamingFast team has proven themselves as experts in building critical infrastructure and providing API services. **StreamingFast will contribute its technology, developer talent, and resources to advance The Graph as a protocol and ecosystem. Relevant IP and products will be open-sourced under The Graph Protocol Github repo and API products will migrate to The Graph Network for backend indexing and querying support.** As a team dedicated to core protocol development, StreamingFast will work alongside Edge & Node, Indexers, and The Graph community to help with ongoing Graph Node improvements, contribute to governance and the GIP process, and support subgraph feature development.

### Figment

Figment is one of the world’s largest blockchain infrastructure and services providers serving customers worldwide. The Figment team is experienced with contributing to protocols, improving node infrastructure and indexing on The Graph. Joining The Graph community allows Figment to contribute to a decentralized and community-owned infrastructure for Web3, powering the future of the Internet. In this role, Figment will contribute to improving indexing performance, adding support for native network subgraphs, expanding multiblockchain support, and contributing to the evolution of the core protocol. Figment’s native DataHub service will also migrate to The Graph for its indexing infrastructure.&#x20;

Figment is a leading provider of staking, middleware, and application layer solutions for token holders and developers investing in and building on Web3 technologies. Their validator infrastructure, data indexers, and developer tooling spans across 35+ proof-of-stake networks, including The Graph. Their technology is already used by thousands of token holders and developers across the globe, with over $6B in assets staked to their infrastructure.

### Semiotic

Semiotic AI, which was founded in 2020 by professionals with experience in AI and cryptography, has been contributing to The Graph core research including automation of query negotiations through reinforcement learning (RL), AI-based determination of query costs, and query latency prediction. The team also open sourced an [Indexer Stress Test](https://forum.thegraph.com/t/indexer-stress-test-tool-release/2119) tool over the summer, and has built an AI-powered query generator that’s currently being heavily used and tested by other core devs!

A 8-year grant by The Graph Foundation enables the Semiotic team to expand their capacity to work on new focus areas such as verifiable queries with optimized zk-SNARKs libraries and decentralizing query cost prediction with neural networks. Semiotic will work with other core dev teams in The Graph ecosystem on research and development focused around artificial intelligence and cryptography and ways to apply these areas to The Graph Network.

### The Guild

[The Guild](https://the-guild.dev/) is a renowned group with experience building GraphQL tooling for top Fortune 500 companies and the open-source community. A well-respected team with deep roots in open-source development, The Guild team [contributed to the GraphQL community](https://the-guild.dev/blog) and developed many open-source libraries, like [GraphQL Mesh](https://the-guild.dev/blog/graphql-mesh), a solution which allows developers to automatically generate a GraphQL API. GraphQL is a widely-used data query language for APIs on top of any other protocol (REST, Swagger/OpenAPI, gRPC and many others) that was developed internally by Facebook in 2012 before its public release in 2015. The Guild is a part of the GraphQL Foundation and contributed to the reference implementation of GraphQL. Over the last 6 years, The Guild has become one of the most experienced GraphQL development groups in the world.

### GraphOps

The GraphOps team brings together a wealth of experience inside and outside of The Graph ecosystem, spanning across protocol design, economics, infrastructure and systems orchestration. They are proven indexing experts, having been active members of the community since the testnet. Their work will expand the quality of service and capacity of The Graph Network and the capabilities of Indexers as the decentralized network scales.

Chris Wessels is joined by Juan Manuel Rodriguez Defango, Ana Maria Calin, Abel Tedros, and Petko Pavlovski. Their years of contribution to The Graph ecosystem gives them the depth of experience and firsthand knowledge of the protocol to provide best-in-class resources and tooling to optimize Indexer experience.

GraphOps has long contributed to The Graph ecosystem, making a significant push to expand resources, information, and education. GraphOps provides a range of support, education, and the development of technology and tooling for Indexers in The Graph ecosystem.
